Complex Responsive Layout with Grid and Flexbox - TASK 9

Objective:
To design a sophisticated webpage layout that combines CSS Grid and Flexbox techniques.


Main properties used:
1) display:grid - used for the overall page layout and container structure.

2) display:flex - used to stack cards vertically and control their spacing in the main.

3) position: sticky/relative - used for both sticky header and sidebar.

4) z-index - controls stacking order, i.e., which element appears in front; the selected card is brought to the front visually by increasing its z-index.
